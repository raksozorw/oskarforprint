# E-Commerce Store for Prints

I take pictures and sometimes sell them as prints.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Context
- Stripe API
- Node.js (mostly utilizing examples from Stripe's excellent documentation)

## What does it do?

- Displays products (prints) received from a request to my Stripe store.
- Basic E-Commerce functions, add/remove to cart, etc.
- Checkout using Stripe Checkout for secure payments
- Handles orders on the backend

## What to improve

- A better cart feature, it works, but could be better
- Host somewhere besides Heroku, so slow...
